# Reduced Volume of diabetic Pancreatic Islets in Rodents Detected by Synchrotron X-ray Phase-contrast Microtomography and Deep Learning Network

This is the code for the paper **"Reduced volume of diabetic pancreatic islets in rodents detected by synchrotron X-ray phase-contrast microtomography and deep learning network"** at Heliyon, 2023. 

- The code is based on: Python 3.6, and pytorch 1.5.0, which includes both the training and testing parts. Please check Requirements.txt for the details on how to setup the code.
- Run /Project_AANet/test.py for testing.
- Run /Projext_AANet/main.py for training.
- Run Certainy_analysis/uncertainy_map.py and  Certainy_analysis/confindence.py for Certainty analysis. 
- Run size.py for estimating the size of islet. 

Thanks!
